            <h3>What do you eat before a Workout?</h3>
            <h5>By Wirula</h5>
                <p>
                    Fitness enthusiasts are always looking for ways to improve their performance and achieve their goals. Good nutrition helps your body perform better and recover faster after each workout. Therefore it does not matter what time of day you put in your workout, you need to be conscious of what you are eating .Each macronutrient has a specific role before a workout. However, the ratio in which you need to consume them varies by the individual and type of exercise. Which foods and how much to eat depends on the type, duration and intensity of the workout. A good rule of thumb is to eat a mixture of carbs and protein prior to exercise. Fueling your body with the right nutrients prior to exercise will give you the energy and strength you need to perform better.
                </p>

            <br>

            <h3>The Macronutrients</h3>
            <h6>Carbohydrates</h6>
                <p>
                    Muscles use the glucose from carbs for fuel. Glycogen is the way the body processes and stores glucose, mainly in the liver and muscles. Glycogen stores are limited. As these stores become depleted, your output and intensity diminish.Carbs increase glycogen stores and utilization while boosting oxidation during exercise. For long exercises, the degree to which carbs are used depends on several factors. These include the intensity, type of training and your overall diet .For shorter and high-intensity exercise, the glycogen stores are your muscles' main source of energy. Carb loading, which involves consuming a high-carb diet for 1–7 days, is a well-known method to maximize glycogen stores
                </p>
            <br>

            <h6>Protein</h6>
            <p>
                Eating protein (alone or with carbs) prior to exercise has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis, a pre-workout protein consumption is also said to improve athletic performance. Other benefits of eating protein before exercise include:
                <ul>
                    <li>A better anabolic response, or muscle growth</li>
                    <li>Improved muscle recovery</li>
                    <li>Increased strength and lean body mass</li>
                    <li>Increased muscle performance</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <br>


            <h6>Fat</h6>
            <p>
            While glycogen is used for short- and high-intensity bouts of exercise, fat is the source of fuel for longer and moderate-to-low-intensity exercise. For example, one study showed how a four-week diet consisting of 40% fat increased endurance running times in healthy, trained runners.

            Summary Carbs help maximize glycogen stores for high-intensity exercise, while fat helps fuel your body for longer, less intense workouts. Meanwhile, protein improves muscle protein synthesis and aids recovery.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Timing of Your Pre-Workout Meal Is Key</h3>
            <p>
                To maximize the results of your training, try to eat a complete meal containing carbs, protein and fat 2–3 hours before
                you exercise.
                In instances where, you may not be able to get in a full meal 2–3 hours before working out, you can still eat a decent
                pre-workout meal. However, keep in mind that the sooner you eat before your workout, the smaller and simpler the meal
                should be.
                If you eat 45–60 minutes prior to your workout, choose foods that are simple to digest and contain mainly carbs and
                some protein. This will help prevent any stomach discomfort during exercise.
                Summary It's recommended to consume a full meal 2–3 hours before your workout. For meals eaten closer to your workout,
                choose simpler carbs and some protein. If you eat fat with your pre-workout meal, then it should be consumed at least a
                few hours before your workout
                Here are some examples of balanced pre-workout meals. Keep in mind that you don't need to eat many pre-workout meals at
                different times. Just choose one, for best results, experiment with different timings and nutrient compositions:


                <h4>If Your Workout Starts Within 2–3 Hours or More</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sandwich on whole-grain bread, lean protein and a side salad</li>
                    <li>Egg omelet and whole-grain toast topped with avocado spread and a cup of fruit</li>
                    <li>Lean protein, brown rice and roasted vegetables</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <h4>If Your Workout Starts Within 2 Hours</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protein smoothie made with milk, protein powder, banana and mixed berries</li>
                    <li>Whole-grain cereal and milk</li>
                    <li>A cup of oatmeal topped with banana and sliced almonds</li>
                </ul>


                <br>


                <h4>If Your Workout Starts Within an Hour or Less</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Greek yogurt and fruit</li>
                    <li>Nutrition bar with protein and wholesome ingredients</li>
                    <li>A piece of fruit, such as a banana, orange or apple</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                Summary A combination of carbs and protein is recommended for pre-workout meals. Fat can also be beneficial, but it
                should be consumed at least two hours before exercise.
            </p>
        <br>

            <h5>Supplements</h5>
        
            Supplement use is common in sports. These products may enhance performance, improve strength, increase lean body mass and reduce fatigue .Below are some:
            <ul>
                <li>Creatine : It has been known to increase muscle mass, muscle fiber size and muscle strength and power, all while delaying fatigue</li>
                <li>Caffeine: has been known to improve performance, increase strength and power, help reduce feelings of fatigue and stimulate fat burning ,can be consumed in coffee, tea and energy drinks.</li>
                <li>Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs): refer to the essential amino acids valine
                    <ul>
                        <li>promotes muscle growth and tissue repair, leucine and isoleucine </li>
                        <li>used in the biosynthesis of proteins. These help decrease muscle damage and increase muscle protein synthesis</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Beta-Alanine: is an amino acid that increase muscle stores of carnosine. It has been known to be most effective for short- and high-intensity exercises by increasing exercise capacity and muscle endurance while reducing fatigue.</li>
                <li>Multi-Ingredient Pre-Workout Supplements: A combination of ingredients that may have synergistic effects and improve performance significantly</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Hydration Is Also Crucial</h6>
            <p>
                Your body needs water to function. Good hydration sustains and even enhances performance, while dehydration has been linked to significant decreases in performance it is recommended to consume both water and sodium before exercise. This will improve fluid balance and retention Summary Water is important for performance. It is recommended to drink water and sodium-containing beverages before exercise to promote fluid balance and prevent excessive fluid loss.

            <h3>What Do You Eat After a Workout?</h3>
            <h6>By Wirula</h6>
            <p>
                If like me you prefer to command your day by getting your workout done first thing in the morning, chances are you may not have given much thought to your post-workout meal. Consuming the right nutrients after you exercise is just a important as what you eat before.
                <br>
                 <h6>Eating After a Workout Is Important</h6>
                 During working out, your muscles use up stored glycogen for fuel and some of the proteins also get broken down and damaged. After your workout, your body tries to rebuild its glycogen stores and repair and regrow those muscle proteins. Eating the right nutrients soon after you exercise can help your body get this done faster. It is recommended to eat carbs and protein after your workout. This helps your body:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enhance recovery.</li>
                        <li>Restore glycogen stores.</li>
                        <li>Decrease muscle protein breakdown.</li>
                        <li>Increase muscle protein synthesis (growth).</li>
                    </ul>
            Getting in the right nutrients after exercise can help you rebuild your muscle proteins and glycogen stores. It also
            helps stimulate growth of new muscle.
            <br><br>
                <h3>Macronutrients and post workout recovery</h3>
                <h6>Carbohydrates Help in Recovery</h6>
                Your body's glycogen stores are used as fuel during exercise, and consuming carbs after your workout helps replenish
                them. The rate at which your glycogen stores are used depends on the activity. For example, endurance sports (running,
                swimming, etc.), cause your body to use more glycogen than resistance training (Weights training). Therefore, consume
                more carbs after endurance.
                Consuming 1.1–1.5 grams of carbs per kg of body weight within 30 minutes after training results in proper glycogen
                resynthesis. Consuming both carbs and protein after exercise can maximize protein and glycogen synthesis .Try consuming
                the two in a ratio of 3:1 (carbs to protein). For example, 40 grams of protein and 120 grams of carbs.
                Eating plenty of carbs to rebuild glycogen stores is most important for people who exercise often, such as twice in the
                same day. If you have 1 or 2 days to rest between workouts then this becomes less important.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Protein Helps Repair and Build Muscle</h5>
                The rate at which muscle protein breakdown during workouts depends on the exercise and your level of training, but even
                well-trained athletes experience this breakdown
                Consuming adequate amounts of protein after a workout gives your body the amino acids needed to repair and rebuild
                these proteins. It also gives you the building blocks required to build new muscle tissue
                It is recommended that you consume 0.3–0.5 grams of protein per kg of body weight very soon after a workout it is
                proven that taking 20–40 grams of protein seems to maximize the body's ability to recover after exercise
                <br><br>
                <h5>Fat Is Not That Bad</h5>
                While fat might slow down the absorption of your post-workout meal, it will not reduce its benefits. For example, it is
                proven that whole milk was more effective at promoting muscle growth after a workout than skim milk it might be a good
                idea to limit the amount of fat you eat after exercise, but having some fat in your post-workout meal will not affect
                your recovery.
                <br><br>


                <h6>The Timing Matters</h6>
                Your body's ability to rebuild glycogen and protein is enhanced after you exercise, it is recommended that you consume
                a combination of carbs and protein as soon as possible after exercising, many experts recommend within 45 minutes.
                It is believed that the delay of carb consumption by as little as two hours after a workout may lead to as much as 50%
                lower rates of glycogen synthesis .However, if you consumed a meal before exercising, it's likely that the benefits
                from that meal still apply after training .
                    <br><br>

                <h6>Foods to Eat After You Workout</h6>
                The primary goal of your post-workout meal is to supply your body with the right nutrients for adequate recovery and to
                maximize the benefits of your workout.
                Choosing easily digested foods will promote faster nutrient absorption.
                The following lists contain examples of simple and easily digested foods:

                <h5>Sample Post-Workout Meals</h5>
                Combinations of the foods listed above can create great meals that provide you with all the nutrients you need after
                exercise.
                Here are a few examples of quick and easy meals to eat after your workout:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grilled chicken with vegetables.</li>
                        <li>Egg omelet with avocado spread on toast.</li>

                <h5>Drink Plenty of Water</h5>
                During exercise, you lose water and electrolytes through sweat. Replenishing these after a workout can help with
                recovery and performance. It is important to drink plenty of water before and after your workout. Proper hydration,
                ensures an optimal internal environment for your body to maximize results
                Depending on the intensity of your workout, water or an electrolyte drink are recommended to replenish fluid losses.
