                Carbohydrates provide energy to your brain, red blood cells and muscles, and account for the majority of the calories
                consumed in a standard diet. The daily carbohydrate requirements for women can vary depending on age, physical activity
                levels, health status and weight. The type of carbohydrate you choose to include in your diet can make a difference in
                your health. Candies, desserts, white bread, white rice and refined breakfast cereals can quickly elevate your blood
                sugar levels, which can put you at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Knowing what kind and how much carbohydrate to
                eat can be confusing! On the nutrition label, the term "total carbohydrate" includes all three types of carbohydrates. i.e
                <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Starches (also known as complex carbohydrates)</li>
                <li>Sugars</li>
                <li>Fiber</li>
            </ul>
                Others are like naturally occurring sugar, added sugar1. A class of carbohydrates with a sweet taste, including
                glucose, fructose and sucrose. 2. A term used to refer to blood glucose.X, low-calorie sweeteners, sugar
                alcoholssweeteners that produce a smaller rise in blood glucose than other carbohydrates. Their calorie content is
                about 2 calories per gram. Includes erythritol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, isomalt, lactitol, maltitol,
                mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol. Also known as polyols (PAH-lee-alls.)X, reduced-calorie sweeteners, processed grains,
                enriched grains, complex carbohydrate, sweets, refined grains and whole grains.
                <br><br>

                Starch
                Foods high in starch include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Starchy vegetables like peas, corn, lima beans and potatoes</li>
                    <li>Dried beans, lentils and peas</li>
                    <li>Grains like oats, barley and rice.</li>
                </ul>

                The grain group can be broken down even further into whole grain or refined grain.
                A grain contains three parts, bran
                <ul>
                    <li>germ</li>
                    <li>endosperm</li>
                </ul>
                The bran is the outer hard shell of the grain. It is the part of the grain that provides the most fiberThe part of food
                that is hard to digest. Foods high in fiber take longer to digest and therefore affect your blood glucose more slowly
                (i.e. whole wheat bread, prunes and other vegetables)X and most of the B vitamins and minerals.
                The germ is the next layer and is packed with nutrients including essential fatty acids and vitamin E.
                The endosperm is the soft part in the center of the grain. It contains the starch
                If you eat a whole grain food, it contains the bran, germ, and endosperm so you get all of the nutrients that whole
                grains have to offer.
                Whole grain means that the entire grain kernel is in the food. If you eat a refined grain food, it contains only the
                endosperm or the starchy part so you miss out on a lot of vitamins and minerals. Because whole grains contain the
                entire grain, they are much more nutritious than refined grains.
                Sugar
                Can be:
                <ul>
                    <li>naturally occurring sugars such as those in milk or fruit</li>
                    <li>added sugars such as those added during processing such as fruit canned in heavy syrup or sugar added to make a
                    cookie</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                On the nutrition facts label, the number of sugar grams includes both added and natural sugars.
                There are many different names for sugar. Examples of common names are table sugar, brown sugar, molasses, honey, beet
                sugar, cane sugar, confectioner's sugar, powdered sugar, maple syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, agave nectar and sugar
                cane syrup.
                Table sugar is also known as sucrosea two-part sugar made of glucose and fructose. Known as table sugar or white sugar,
                it is found naturally in sugar cane and in beets.X. Fruit sugar is also known as fructose and the sugar in milk is
                called lactose. You can recognize other sugars on labels because their chemical names also end in "-ose." For example
                glucose (also called dextrose), fructose (also called levulose), lactose and maltose.
                <br><br>

                Fiber
                Fiber comes from plant foods so there is no fiber in animal products such as milk, eggs, meat, poultry, and fish. It is
                the part of plant foods that is edible, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes. When you consume
                dietary fiber, most of it passes through the intestines and is not digested.
                Make sure that at least half of the grains you eat are whole grains because you won’t get any fiber unless you eat the
                whole grain. The best sources of fiber are beans, while some of the top choices for soluble fiber include bran, oats,
                beans, broccoli, brussels sprouts, carrots, green peas, apples, oranges and pears. Fiber contributes to digestive
                health, helps to keep you regular, and helps to make you feel full and satisfied after eating. Additionally reduction
                in cholesterola type of fat produced by the liver and found in the blood; it is also found in some foods. Cholesterol
                is used by the body to make hormones and build cell walls.X levels — have been suggested by some so may be an
                additional benefit.
                
                
                Some sources of dietary fiber include:
                <ul>
                <li>Beans and legumes, fruits and vegetables, especially those with edible skin (for example, apples, corn and beans) and
                those with edible seeds (for example, berries).</li>
                <li>Whole grains such as wheat pasta, whole grain cereals whole wheat, wheat bran, and oats. Whole grain breads (at least
                three grams of fiber, look for breads where the first ingredient is a whole grain)</li>
                <li>Nuts — try different kinds. Peanuts, walnuts and almonds are a good source of fiber and healthy fatone of the three
                main nutrients in food. Foods that provide fat are butter, margarine, salad dressing, oil, nuts, meat, poultry, fish
                and some dairy products. 2. Excess calories are stored as body fat, providing the body with a reserve supply of energy
                and other functions.X, but watch portion sizes, because they also contain a lot of calories in a small amount.</li>

                <br><br>

                Women should consume 130 grams of total carbohydrates daily, which includes all the three types of carbs: sugar, starch
                and fiber. It is recommended that this constitutes 45 %to 65 % of your total daily calories .If you eat more
                carbohydrates than the recommended amount, your diet may not be balanced. Eating too many carbs may mean that you’re
                not getting enough protein and fat in your diet.high-fiber nutritious carbohydrates like fruits, steel-cut oats,
                quinoa, sweet potatoes, plain yogurt and vegetables provide carbohydrates that are less disruptive for your blood sugar
                levels, in addition to giving you fiber, vitamins and antioxidants.

                Based on the above food combinations, many of us end up consuming much higher than the recommended daily consumption of
                carbs. If your aim is weight loss, rreducing the amount and source of carbs you consume is one of the ways. It is also
                important to increase your fiber intake gradually, to prevent stomach irritation, and also increase your intake of
                water and other liquids, to prevent constipation.
